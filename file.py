import sys

# Purpose: Reads a file specified by the user, sums pairs of float numbers from each line,
#          and prints the cumulative sum after each line.
# Input: `filename` - a string representing the name of a text file, passed as a command-line argument.
# Output: Prints the cumulative sum of each pair of floats in the file. Prints an error message if
#         a line doesnâ€™t contain exactly 2 numbers, if values aren't valid floats, or if the file doesn't exist.
# Data Representation: The file contains lines with two numbers (space-separated), which are summed per line.
